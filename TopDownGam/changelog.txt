4th of April

Made this on another file cause I was doing big changes and 
didnt want to fuck up my main code, moved collision logic into 
Player.cs, as well as generation and texture creation. Because 
most if ny collision checks involved changing states, adding points
etc, i moved them to player.cs instead of creating a new one to avoid
any hassle or whatever. Proud of what i did :3
